[Become a Solver](/guides/become-solver) to fill cross-chain intents. Requires 0.5 ETH stake.

[Run an RPC Node](/guides/run-rpc-node) to operate infrastructure. Requires stake.

[Run a Compute Node](/guides/run-compute-node) to provide AI inference. Requires 0.1 ETH stake.

[Run a Storage Node](/guides/run-storage-node) to provide IPFS storage. Requires 0.1 ETH stake.

## Integration Guides

[Register a Token](/guides/register-token) to enable your token for gas payments.

[Register an Agent](/guides/register-agent) to create ERC-8004 identity for your app.

[Deploy an Agent](/guides/deploy-agent) to run agents on Crucible.

[Gasless Transactions](/guides/gasless-transactions) to use paymasters for gas abstraction.
