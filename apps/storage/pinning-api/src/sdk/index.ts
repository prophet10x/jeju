/**
 * Network Storage SDK
 *
 * Decentralized storage marketplace with:
 * - Multi-provider support (IPFS, Cloud, Arweave)
 * - Automatic best provider selection
 * - x402 micropayments
 * - ERC-4337 multi-token payments
 * - A2A and MCP integration
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 * - provider-interface.ts: Defines the interface ALL providers must implement
 * - marketplace-client.ts: Client for compute/other services to discover and use providers
 * - Vendor code (Vercel, S3, R2) is in backends/ and wrapped to implement the interface
